                        Alphashack is an incubator for products, which has suited my full stack
                        skills. The primary product that I work on is Graphdat, a real time server and application visualisation platform. This product has had many challenges involved in scaling the system to deal with lots of data coming and at the same serving aggregates in real time. Working in a small team I've worked across the whole stack jumping into code as needed. The product is fully functional and can be seen at http://www.graphdat.com

                        The product I worked on in this position was the iOS (iPhone and iPad)
                        remote for the fetchtv set-top box. The application uses a comet system
                        to communicate to the set-top box, some of the trickier aspects of this
                        was ensuring that the communication would work outside the home over 3G
                        as well as on WiFi indoors. We initial produced a prototype using sencha-touch
                        but then elected to write in native Objective-C so that we could get as
                        much performance as possible. My role had me doing most of the low level
                        communications and API creation for use by the rest of the team.

                        As a solution architect I was responsible for the translation of business
                        requirements into functional requirements for the development team. It
                        was my responsibility to ensure that the various products of the company
                        meshed well together and that the appropriate technologies were used. As
                        well as filling the role of solution architect I was also the team leader
                        for the Viostream product team. The Viostream platform is the video streaming
                        and asset management offering from Viocorp. I was required to both design
                        and develop features for this platform to suit the needs of Viocorp’s clients.

                    <p>
                        Amongst my accomplishments in this position, I filled in as team lead
                        for the Viomedia Product team for the development of a catch-up TV solution
                        for Malaysia’s largest broadcaster. This proved to be an incredibly difficult
                        task as I was required to take an existing CMS and rework it to suit the
                        catch - up TV requirements. The project was finished on time and has since
                        changed the browsing habits for the viewers of the client.

                    <p>
                        As a .NET developer my primary job was to build and skin video portals
                        for major banking institutions, national tourism bodies and large multinationals.
                        I worked to tight deadlines to create an individual look and feel to each
                        client’s video portal.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In additional to building and skinning video portals I rebuilt the interface
                        to the core management system used for managing client media. This involved
                        rethinking the usability of the existing system and introducing a “Web
                        2.0” feel to the site . In the space of three months the entire interface
                        and workflow for clients was reinvented.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My major accomplishment was a Javascript embed framework that that supports
                        the embedding of Adobe Flash, Windows Media and Apple Quicktime content
                        onto a site whilst allowing the user to change between formats. The framework
                        is completely encapsulated and does not make use of any other Javascript
                        library. The system makes use of a degrading tag system that allows for
                        the embed system to also be used in an AJAX environment . The end result
                        was that clients could paste an embed code into their CMS and serve online
                        video to their viewers regardless of platform.

                    <p>
                        I was offered the position of associate software engineer in the US office
                        and spent a year working on various projects. I spent a significant amount
                        of time converting old ASP applications into ASP.NET in order to better
                        meet changing business needs. An example of this was a generic document
                        templating system that I built using XML and Xquery to replace the existing
                        Knowledge Base system. The document layout and submitted data was stored
                        in XML. On rendering Xquery methods were used to select and update the
                        information stored in SQL.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I was also part of the team that rebuilt DataBuffet.com from the ground
                        up. Using a C# for the backend, and jQuery for the frontend, we created
                        a responsive, robust chart and mapping tool for use with the company's
                        data warehouse (FAME). For this project I wrote various jQuery plugins
                        to streamline the frontend processes. On the backend various VB6, C++ and
                        SQL pieces of code had to be rewritten. The project included creating webservices
                        to store your own data, so that you could use the tools to chart and/or
                        map your data against other economic data.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Possibly the toughest project I undertook was adding a coupon to the existing
                        shopping cart system. Due to the nature of the existing system I had to
                        graft the coupon system using only SQL. This involved building all the
                        pieces and slowly moving them into the live system so that there wouldn't
                        be any disruption to service. This was tricky because of the system had
                        been written over 10 years prior. At the end of it the company ended up
                        with a robust coupons system that allowed for everything from bundles to
                        bulk discounts.
